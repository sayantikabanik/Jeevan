## (Prosthetics Management System)
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The project revolves around with the intention of making it easier for the
needy to get access to Prosthetics easier. Internet is a pretty vast and the
amount of information one can get through Internet is immense. One spends
more time in researching than actually getting what he/she exactly wants .<br>

This project helps in bringing down the research time. The website model
contains all essential information one requires in order to make choosing
Prosthetics easier. It contains a detailed statistics of Prosthetics. The materials
used to produce the Prosthetics, the location where it is available, the price
and a brief description of each and every item is exhibited on the portal. This
makes decision making easier for customers.<br>

The project also has a cart featured in it . This makes choosing various items
and getting to the summary page easier. The design of the project is made in
an efficient way such that the customers will not face any difficulty in
navigating around the website.</p1>
