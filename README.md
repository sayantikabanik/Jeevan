## (Prosthetics Management System)
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The project revolves around the idea of allowing the needy to have easier access to Prosthetics. 
The Internet is pretty vast and the amount of information one can get through the Internet is immense. 
People spend more time researching products that they are interested in than actually acquiring what he/she wants or needs.<br>

This project helps by reducing the amount of time people will need to spend doing research. 
The website model contains all the essential information  that one requires in order to make choosing
Prosthetics easier. It contains detailed statistics on various types of Prosthetics as well as the information about the 
Prosthetics. 
<h4>This information includes:<h4> 
<ul>
<li>Materials used to produce the Prosthetics</li>
<li>The locations where the Prosthetics are available</li>
<li>Estimated prices</li>
<li>A brief description</li>
</ul>
All this information helps achieve the goal of allowing people to choose Prosthetics with ease.</br>
 
The project also has a cart featured in it which makes choosing various items
and getting to the summary page faster and easier. The design of the project is made in
an efficient way such that the customers will not face any difficulty in
navigating around the website.</p1>
